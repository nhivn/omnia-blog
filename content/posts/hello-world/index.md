Hello world!

Welcome to my first blog post ever!

## A brief self-introduction

If you know me in real life, you probably have heard me said this:

> Hi, I'm Nhi, like the knee on your leg.

As you also could have guessed, I'm a software developer who writes broken English. I enjoy writing softwares that users like to use and developers like to dev on.

When I am trying to learn and understand something new, I would note them down in this blog. So, please don't take my learning notes as the words of wisdom.

## 📖 Reading

✔️ = I have read enough of the book or enough of articles from the publisher to give green tick!

👓 = I'm still mid-way through the book or waiting to read the book.

### Programming

I read books and random articles I found online so I will list both in the list.

✔️ **Clean Code** <br/> _the book that every developer should read to be aware_

✔️ **Design Patterns (Go4)** <br/> _for those moments when you are like "Oh, what does this pattern called 'Factory' do?" I won't read it by itself for fun_

✔️ **Hackernoon** <br/> _they have a lot of good articles_

✔️ **Better Programming** <br/> _I also enjoy a lot of their articles_

✔️ **Weekly suggestions from Medium** <br/> _They are pretty good to be honest_

👓 **Clean Architecture**

👓 **C# in depth** <br/> _So far it's a good book but I won't pick up a programming language specific book again_

### Others

I won't list out classics because they have enough exposure from other people's highly recommended reading list.

✔️ **Sapiens** by Yuval Noah Harari

✔️ **The subtle art of not giving a f*ck**
