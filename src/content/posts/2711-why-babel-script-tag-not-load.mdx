# Problem

> The script tag with type "text/babel" will always load in a list of other script tags with type "text/javascript" even if it is written before all the other tags.

Imagine there is a HTML file and some JS files lurking in a hypothetical project somewhere in this universe. 

The HTML file looks something like this.

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <!-- Imagine some content here -->

    <script src="./src/foo.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="./src/bar.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="./src/baz.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The universe wants to use some new shiny ECMAscript features (which is probably not yet supported in some browsers) in `foo.js` which means you will now need to compile that file using Babel. But your hypothetical project has some drawbacks, that is, you can't compile the JS file server-side, leaving you with only one other option: compiling in the browser.

Well, no big deal, you just need to import the babel minified js file and change the script tag that sourced foo.js to have type `text/babel`.

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <!-- Imagine some content here -->

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./src/foo-babel.js" type="text/babel"></script>
    <script src="./src/bar.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="./src/baz.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

But then you try to load the HTML and the console just screams at you: `foo is undefined bar.js:1`. Apparently, the first line of `bar.js` is something like this:

```js
var fooResult = foo.doSomething();
```

And apparently that `foo` being referenced there is `undefined`.

Now, I was in this situation and the first thing that I thought was:
"What the heck? `foo` is loaded before `bar`. It's written a line before `bar`. How is it not defined?!"

I dug through the Network tab on my browser and found out that `foo-babel.js` was loaded after **both** `bar.js` and `baz.js`. I think I was losing my mind at that point like hallucinating. 

A fact check:

> Script tags load synchonously unless you use the `defer` or `async` attribute.

Google said, "That's true".

After some time of mucking around and intensed refreshing of the HTML, I accepted the fact that **`foo-babel.js` will always load last**. 

# But why?

As it turns out, if you look into the non-minified [@babel/standalone/babel.js](view-source:https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.7.4/babel.js) file (as of version `7.7.4`), you will find some line codes of that look like that.

```js
function onDOMContentLoaded() {
  transformScriptTags();
}

if (typeof window !== "undefined" && window && window.addEventListener) {
  window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", onDOMContentLoaded, false);
}

function transformScriptTags(scriptTags) {
  runScripts(transform, scriptTags);
}
```

I saw those 6 lines (well, 9) and well, everything makes sense now.

> Babel waits until after the DOM content is loaded (read: after all the other script tags have been parsed) then transforms the script tag with "text/babel" type.

Here is an illustration indicating what time `foo-babel.js`, `bar.js` and `baz.js` are executed and when the `DOMContentLoaded` (more about this event on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event)) event happens if you are more of a picture person.

Wait for it...

# Conclusion

I ended up solving my problem by saying "No, universe, let's not use shiny new ECMAscript features in `foo-babel.js`. Let's not go there if our project couldn't support server-side compile and all the JS files keep reference each other."
